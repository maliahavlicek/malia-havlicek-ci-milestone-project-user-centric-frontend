## Personal Portfolio Milestone Project 1
This website is for recruiters and future employeers to browse the work history, professional goals, and skills of a future employee, Malia Havlicek in the role of a full stack 
web developer. It was designed to present a resume to recruiters as an intuitve website both on mobile devices and desktops. 

The home page provides future employeers with a brief overview of my beliefs concerning software development. They can read up on my education, browse
my skill set, link to code examples, see recommendations, and link to social media profiles. This information will help provide recruiters and future employeers with a feel
to my personality as well as my qualifications as a fullstack web developer.

## UX 
To best highlight a software developer's competence, a personalized portfolio website provides information similar to a standard resume with the
added bonus of being built with the skill set the cadidate wishes to demonstrate experience in. It should present nicely on phones and laptops.

The first stage of the portfolio website was determining a design and what information to present. The following sketches were drawn:
- [About Me](https://maliahavlicek.github.io/malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend/images/Mockups/Mockup-AboutMe.jpg)  - landing page with mission statement, education and awards
- [Experience](https://maliahavlicek.github.io/malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend/images/Mockups/Mockup-Experience.jpg)  - provide work history summary
- [Skills](https://maliahavlicek.github.io/malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend/images/Mockups/Mockup-Skills.jpg)  - graphs and lists highlighting skills, aptitude, and depth of knowledge
- [Navigation](https://maliahavlicek.github.io/malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend/images/Mockups/Mockup-More.jpg)  - layout of navigation

From the design stage, the following user stories were created:
- <strong>Mission Statement: </strong>As a recruiter, I want to know my candidate's mission statement so I can determine if the candidate is a good fit culturally for the company I'm recruiting for.
- <strong>Education Summary: </strong>As a candidate, I want my future employeers to know that I am dedicated to persuing knowledge so they know I am not picking up coding as an ad hoc career.
- <strong>Awards and Recongition: </strong>As a candidate, I want recruiters to know that my peers and past employeers thought I a good employee so that future employeers know I am worthy of being hired.
- <strong>Navigation: </strong>As a website user, I want to easily and intuitvely move throughout the profile both on desktop and small devices so I do not have to scroll through tons of information to find what I am looking for.
- <strong>Footer: </strong>As a candidate, I want my contact information to be readily available to recruiters and future employeers so they can contact me without searching or clicking to other pages.
- <strong>Experience: </strong>As a recruiter, I want to see that a candidate has practical experience in the field I am hiring for so that I find qualififed candidates fast.
- <strong>Skills: </strong>As a recruiter, I want to see the skills a candidate pocesses so that I know they meet the requirements for the position I am trying to fill.
- <strong>Recommendations: </strong> As a candidate, I want to highlight the good things past co-workers have said about me so that future employeers know I am a great find.


## Features
This portfolio consists of 4 destinct pages: About Me, Experience, Skills, Recommendations and a header and footer. The pages will be rendered such that they look and function well
on mobile phones, tablets and laptops.
1. <strong>About Me: </strong>This is a landing page for the portfolio. It provides a first glimps at a candidate. The mission statement provides a look at the candidate's
personaliaty and what they hope to provide to a future employeer. There is an edcuation summary section which links to the education institution's website and documents the degree 
obtained and graduation date. The awards and recogintion section provides a quick list highlighting past employeer recogintion.
1. <strong>Experience: </strong> This page provides a work history of the candidate as a list of positions. Each section sumarizes a position held by the candidate along with the duration
and a description of what the candiate did while in that role.
1. <strong>Skills: </strong>The skils page provides insightful graphical interpretations of the candidate's skill set. It has four sections: Current Job Focus, Front End Skills,
Skills Most Recently Used and Past Experience. The unique representation of skills in this manner shows the progression of skills overtime as technology changes.
1. <strong>Recommendations: </strong>The recommendations page highlights past co-workers praise from all sorts of roles. This section highlights the candidate's ability to present
information highlighting their CSS proficiency. 
1. <strong>Header: </strong>The header provides navigation links and a graphic header to represent what page the user is currently on. It is responsive and has a different presenation
for small devices to ensure that important information is displayed above the page fold on small devices as well as desktops.
1. <strong>Footer: </strong>The footer provides consistent quick links to the candidate's email, phone and social media accounts so that recruiters do not have to navigate to contact her.

### Features Left to Implement
- <strong>Code Examples Page:</strong> Rather than a link to github, update to an individual page that incluces a picture of past sites developed and links to them as
as well as code pen.
- <strong>Photo Gallery:</strong> Provide a photo gallery with work snapshots to show that candidate works hard and has fun doing it.

## Technologies Used
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) The project uses **CSS** to define DOM appearance. 
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) The project uses **HTML** to define DOM elements.
- [colors.co](https://coolors.co/) I used a colors.co's color pallet tool to help pick complementary colors.

## Testing

### Validation Testing
Used the following validators to test the code:
- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Note, any error associated with root: color varaibles were ignored.
- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing
For device testing, I would ideally have access to browser stack and derive a list of iOs devices and versions to test with from 
[David Smith's site](https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/). Likewise, I would make use of stats from [android](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) 
to handpick android devices and versions to test with.  Then I'd test top browsers on PC's and Macs using the statics from [w3Counter](https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php). 
Since I don't have a handful of devices or a proper testing tool suite at my fingertips, I'm going to rely on Chrome Dev tools and my windows PC.  

Below are the scenarios I picked to test my website:
* Windows 10, Edge
* Windows 10, Chrome
* Chrome Emulator iphone 6
* Chrome Emulator iPadAir
* Chrome Emulator Pixel 2
* Chrome Emulator Galaxy S5



## Deployment

- I first set up a GitHub repository on my GitHub account. I named it 'malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend'.
- After my first stage of developing my website on Cloud9, I deployed it to the GitHub repository.
- I first pushed my index page and css file, and then added more files later.
- I then set up GitHub as a master branch, allowing it to be used as a GiHub page.
- The webpage is now hosted on [GitHub](https://maliahavlicek.github.io/malia-havlicek-ci-milestone-project-user-centric-frontend/)

## Project Description
This project was created in order to highlight my newly revamped skills with HTML and CSS. 

The project is aimed at meeting these core requirements:
1. <strong>Demonstrated use of the technologies taught:</strong> Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
1. <strong>Structure:</strong> Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
1. <strong> Documentation:</strong> Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
1. <strong>Version Control:</strong> Use Git & GitHub for version control.
1. <stropg>Attribution:</strong> Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
1. <strong>Deployment:</strong> Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

## Technology
This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 hosted by AWS. GitHub was used to manage the code and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.

### CSS Philosophy
Bootstraps is a rather heavy library that carries around a lot of styles and functions that would not be used in this project so I decided to learn as much as I could.

- <strong>colors.css: </strong> Since I'm terrible with color schemes, I decided it would be best to define these in one spot and have the CSS refer to them so if I change a color, I won't have to 
- upate a hex value in numerous spots. Idea from: https://codeburst.io/css-variables-explained-with-5-examples-84adaffaa5bd
- <strong>grid.css: </strong> I need responsive CSS and I like the grid stuff so I'm trying a minimal setup.

### Browser Testing
- For device testing, I would normally do a lot of cross browser and device testing. I'd use stats from David Smith's site: [this page](https://david-smith.org/iosversionstats/) to determine what to test for iOS devices and I'd use stats from android: [this page](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards). Since I don't have a handful of devices or a proper testing tool,
- I'm a bit reliant upon Chrome Dev tools and my old windows PC, thus I hand picked scenarios to test my website.

- These are the scenarios I tested:
    * Windows 10, Edge
    * Windows 10, Chrome
    * Chrome Emulator iphone 6
    * Chrome Emulator iPadAir
    * Chrome Emulator Pixel 2
    * Chrome Emulator Galaxy S5
